      Michael created NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA), which is a free and
      open-source, portable screen reader for Microsoft Windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Michael and his partner, Jamie Teh, started developing software
      that enables blind people to use a computer, they wanted to make it free
      to ensure it was accessible to anyone who needed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael and Jamie created NVDA using an expensive screen reader called
      JAWS (Job Access With Speech), and they did it even though they were
      blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael focuses on software development in the area of accessibility,
      and he is also very passionate about helping the blindness community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Michael has built relationships with companies such as Mozilla,
      Microsoft, Google and Adobe, and has contributed to the accessibility of
      their products.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Screen Reader project went up to the next level when Curran was
      invited to a disability conference in the US, where he was able to
      present the technology to some of the world’s leading IT companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      While NVDA has partnerships with Big Tech companies such as Mozilla,
      Microsoft and Google, it has developed internationally into a sort of
      blind people’s technology club, with the screen reader being translated
      from English into more than 55 different languages by volunteers in each
      country who undertake the translation.
    </p>
    <p>
      This level of involvement among the blind community internationally
      makes NVDA unique in its field, as access to its screen reader is free,
      while other screen readers can cost up to $3000.

    <div id="divID">
      <cite>“We’d say things like <br />‘gee, wouldn’t it be good if we could
        develop free software instead of having to pay thousands for it’.”<br />
        “We've always been driven by the idea that everyone, <br />no matter
        their ability, <br />has a right and responsibility to contribute to
        society. But some people may require a few extra tools to do
        it.”</cite>
